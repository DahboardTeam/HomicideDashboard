## Initial Ideas

There will be four tabs in total to depict the homicide cases data in America: geographical distribution,  Rose chart breaking down by season and month, the direction of crimes among different race and gender groups with a Sankey graph, and the trend line graph by gender over time.  

The first tab is designed to mainly demonstrate the geographical distribution of homicide over America, with a date selection component, a drop-down menu to filter weapon categories and a bar chart to summarize race and gender aggregation. By using this tab the user can easily filter out the interested subset and observe how those cases are distributed geographically.

The second tab is to show the frequency of homicide is regulated by season or month. By changing the drop-down menu, users can select the cases given specific relationship, weapon, crime type and state.

The third tab aims to show specific *crime corridors* between different race and gender groups. The area sitting on the left and right side means the percentage of that group as perpetrator or Victim. The width of the line connecting each group indicates the count of cases.
