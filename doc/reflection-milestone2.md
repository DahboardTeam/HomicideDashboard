# Features Implemented
Our dashboard is spread across 2 tabs of content.

## Tab 1
* Shows count of homicides in the US by States, and presents the data according to the gender of the victim and the perpetrator
* Can filter the count of homicides across year values and weapon type values
* By selecting a state, shows line chart and bar chart about counts of homicides by month and by perpetrator race
* The page accomplishes a relatively good level of interactivity, by selecting different continents, all three graphs change accordingly

## Tab 2
* Shows count of homicides in the US across months
* Can filter this count of homicides across 3 column values: homicide across months for each US state, weapon type, relationship type

# Features To Improve On

## Tab 1
* Beautification of slider and checkbox 
* Add `select all` in checkbox to select all weapon type valus 
* Change three plots' sizes to fit the page well and can be transformed when the page size varies

## Tab 2
* Crime type filter in rose graph not that helpful, consider filtering by another column
* Since too many values within each column (e.g. State column has 50 values to filter upon), consider clustering values into groups (e.g. Northeastern US)
* More encodings into rose graph (e.g. color for weapon type).

## Tab1 & Tab2
* Unify and beautify page style

# Features Not Yet Implemented

* Did not yet add Sankey graph to visualize distribution of attacker-victim relationships.
