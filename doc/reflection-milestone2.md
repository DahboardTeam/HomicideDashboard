# Features Implemented
Our dashboard is spread across 2 tabs of content.

## Tab 1

## Tab 2
* Shows count of homicides in the US across months
* Can filter this count of homicides across 3 column values: homicide across months for each US state, weapon type, relationship type

# Features To Improve On

## Tab 2
* Crime type filter in rose graph not that helpful, consider filtering by another column
* Since too many values within each column (e.g. State column has 50 values to filter upon), consider clustering values into groups (e.g. Northeastern US)
* More encodings into rose graph (e.g. color for weapon type).

# Features Not Yet Implemented

* Did not yet add Sankey graph to visualize distribution of attacker-victim relationships.
